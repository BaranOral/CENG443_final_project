# Project Description 

Speed up sorting algorithm using GPU Threads. I found an article about this topic they includes some algrotihms can be parellazied in GPU and they significintlay speed up.
I want to implement a CUDA program which is reduce time complexity of following sorting algorithms.
- Buble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
